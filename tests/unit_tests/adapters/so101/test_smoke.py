"""Process-level smoke test: drive every emitted SO-101 tool via the smoke harness.

Mirrors the plan §A7 requirement: call ``smoke_test_api`` in-process with a fake
env (driver spy already bound) so every action runs once and its return
is JSON-serializable — surfacing spelling/contract bugs that static validation
cannot. No LeRobot / hardware needed.
