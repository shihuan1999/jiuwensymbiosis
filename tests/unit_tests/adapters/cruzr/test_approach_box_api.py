"""approach_for_grasp: SQUARE-FIRST converge loop — each iteration re-detects and drives the base until it
faces ONE of the box's vertical FACES at the grasp distance. The dual-arm clamp closes along base-Y and
ignores box yaw, so the base must square to a face for the paddles to land flat. On a differential base
(no strafe) chasing centring after squaring rotates the box back off-square — so the loop squares FIRST
(rotate in place, forward=0, to face a footprint-axis normal) then advances STRAIGHT in (turn=0), which
preserves the square. Which face is HYSTERESIS-LOCKED on the first footprint frame (``prev_normal``) and
only re-picked near that lock afterwards, so a jittery footprint yaw can't 90°-flip it — near-square and
~corner-on boxes now square to a face too (any face is an acceptable grasp face for a near-cube box that
fits the clamp either way), instead of the old radial fallback that could leave the base ~45° corner-on.
The accept tolerance is ``grasp_square_tol_rad`` (must exceed the footprint-yaw jitter, else a jittery box
only ever rotates and never advances). The plain ``_det`` helper below carries no footprint (no yaw_rad),
so it takes the plain radial centre-and-advance path — unchanged."""
