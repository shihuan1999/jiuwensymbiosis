"""Head+waist coordinated search for _face_by_sweep (shared by face_object / face_surface).

The narrow, short-range waist RGBD can't resolve a far target; the wide-FOV head camera gives a
bearing only. So the search tries the waist first (precise 3-D → align now) and, on a miss, PANS the
head to scan the current facing (look left + right once each). A head hit hands off to a coarse
approach that turns to the bearing and CREEPS FORWARD continuously (``--forward`` worker) while
steering by the target's true base-frame bearing (live head yaw + in-image bearing) and yaw-tracking
the head to keep the target centred, until the waist acquires. If the head scan finds nothing, the base rotates 180° ONCE and the head
re-scans the half behind us. Fully mocked: real rotate_base path (fake LL) + mock drive worker +
monkeypatched waist/head detectors. The head is set to 2-look (``[0.6, -0.6]``) so per-scan
head-call counts are deterministic (the deployed "left + right once" config).
