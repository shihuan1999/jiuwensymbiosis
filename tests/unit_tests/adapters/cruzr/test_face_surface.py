"""face_surface: sensor-guided base reorientation — turn by the PERCEIVED surface bearing
(no-op when facing). When not in the current waist view, the head PANS to scan the facing (look
left + right once); on a miss the base rotates 180° ONCE and the head re-scans behind — no
continuous base spin. These tests drive the pure-waist paths (head detector always not-found);
the head+waist coordinated search is covered in test_face_head_assist.py."""
