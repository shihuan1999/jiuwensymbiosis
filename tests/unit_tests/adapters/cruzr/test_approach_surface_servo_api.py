"""Continuous straight-in place-side creep (opt-in via ``place_servo_enabled``) for approach_for_place.

These drive ``_approach_for_place_continuous_servo`` with a scripted ``locate_for_place`` stream and a
``_ServoLL`` stub that records every start/steer/hold/stop, pinning its contract: once the base is SQUARED
to the near edge, creep continuously STRAIGHT to ``place_approach_edge_m`` and stop the base EXACTLY ONCE
(no per-frame stop-to-look freeze — the reported place-side stutter), NEVER feed a non-zero turn (a carried
box must not be flung off the edge normal), HOLD the wheels on a far loss and resume STRAIGHT once
re-acquired, and commit the final short segment open-loop on a near loss. The first ``approach_for_place``
sense is a squared+far edge so the discrete loop hands straight off to the servo; later senses are the
servo's own re-senses. Mirrors ``test_approach_servo_api.py``'s ``_ServoLL`` and ``test_approach_for_place.py``'s
``_surf_edge``."""
