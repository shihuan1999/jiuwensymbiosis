"""A second dual-arm mobile body must run 支 B without borrowing a line from cruzr.

The claim being tested is that the mobile-manipulation layer is generic. The only
way to show that is to build a body that has never met the adapter it was extracted
from — ``tests.mocks.mock_dual_arm`` mixes the framework mixins, supplies the three
genuinely body-specific pieces (frame, detector, dual-arm actuation), and inherits
everything else. If 支 B compiles against its action index and then drives its base
to the crate, the search / squaring / approach algorithms are body-agnostic in fact.

``planner._chat`` is patched, so what runs is the skill's own workflow, not a model's
improvisation — and the physics under it is a rendered world, so the approach loop has
to genuinely converge rather than be told that it did.
