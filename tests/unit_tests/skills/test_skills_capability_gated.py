"""visual_pick / visual_place are capability-branched (gripper 支 A / dual-arm 支 B).

The deterministic capability filter (``_filter_skills_md_by_capability``) shows a
robot only the branch/steps its capabilities support, and drops a whole skill whose
frontmatter ``capabilities`` (requires-any) the robot lacks — so a fixed-arm gripper
robot never sees dual-arm actions, a dual-arm robot never sees gripper actions, and a
base-less robot never sees ``transport`` or the mobile-base steps.
