"""The spatial qualifier is decided once, then shown — not derived twice.

LLM① reads "the table the banana is on" off the task and every step is validated
against what it decided. Leaving that out of LLM②'s prompt made LLM② derive the
same thing again from the same sentence, and the only way it learned its answer
differed was by being rejected — a round trip per disagreement, on a fact nobody
had restated. These tests pin that both tiers are now told.
