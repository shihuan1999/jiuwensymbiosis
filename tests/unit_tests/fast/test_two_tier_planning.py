"""Planning must survive an empty skill library, and a plan must survive the world moving.

Three properties, one loop. First: the skill library is a shortcut, not a
prerequisite — strip every SKILL.md and the planner still has to derive a working
sequence from the action contracts alone, because that is the only way a body can
do something nobody wrote a skill for. Second: having a second tier must not cost
anything when the first one works — a task the library covers is **one** LLM call,
so the fallback is paid for only when it is used. Third: the sequence was planned
against a belief, so when the measured state contradicts the next step the runner
must re-plan from what is actually true rather than drive on or give up.

The LLM (``planner._chat``) is monkeypatched, so what is under test is the routing
between the tiers and the runner's drift handling — never the model.
