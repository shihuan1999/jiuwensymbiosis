# Robot Environment, Capability, and Tool API Reference

> Category: Reference. The [Chinese source](../../zh/reference/robot-api.md) is authoritative.

## `RobotObservation`

```python
RobotObservation(
    pose: dict | None = None,
    joints: list[float] | None = None,
    rgb: numpy.ndarray | None = None,
    depth: numpy.ndarray | None = None,
    extra: dict = {},
)
```

Pose fields follow the adapter convention: SCARA commonly uses `x/y/z/r`, while a six-axis body uses
`x/y/z/rx/ry/rz`. Joint units must match the Env's `move_joint()` contract. Camera depth is normally represented in
meters at acquisition boundaries.

## `BaseRobotEnv`

Subclasses implement:

```python
connect() -> None
disconnect() -> None
get_observation() -> RobotObservation
home() -> None
```

`home` is abstract because it backs the one unconditional action: a Cartesian default would smuggle
`motion.cartesian` into bodies the capability gate cannot stop. Optional lifecycle hooks are `reset()` and
`emergency_stop()`. The base class supplies default delegations for `get_flange_pose`, `move_to_flange`,
`move_joint`, `set_end_effector`, and `grab_rgb` when the low-level driver satisfies the corresponding Protocol.

Common contract properties include:

- `capabilities` and `low_level`;
- `z_min_safe`, `workspace_bounds`, and `joint_limits`;
- `home_pose` and `tool_offset_mm`.

`has(capability)` checks the declaration. An unknown capability raises `ValueError` when the subclass is created.

## `BaseRobotApi` and capability Mixins

`BaseRobotApi(env)` retains the Env reference. Its `capabilities` property is the union of `capability` declarations in
the Mixin MRO.

| Mixin | Capability | Main tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MotionMixin` | `motion.cartesian` | home, pose query, cartesian and directional motion |
| `JointMotionMixin` | `motion.joint` | joint-space movement |
| `SuctionMixin` | `grasp.suction` | suction engage/release |
| `ParallelGripperMixin` | `grasp.parallel` | gripper open/close |
| `VisionMixin` | `vision.detection` | image, detection, projection, and scene analysis |

Motion, joints, grasp, and `get_image()` delegate to the Env by default. `VisionMixin` implements the shared
`get_grasp_info_simple()` and `pixel_to_base_xyz()` pipeline; an adapter provides `_project_pixel_to_base_raw()` and
implements `analyze_scene()` only when it needs that optional higher-level tool.

## Known capabilities

- `motion.cartesian`
- `motion.joint`
- `motion.servo`
- `grasp.suction`
- `grasp.parallel`
- `vision.camera`
- `vision.depth`
- `vision.detection`
- `vision.eye_to_hand`
- `sorting.command`
- `speech.tts`

The source of truth is `jiuwensymbiosis.env.base.KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`.

## `@implements(SPEC)`

```python
implements(spec: ActionSpec) -> Callable   # api/actions.py
```

The one way a method becomes a tool. It attaches a `ToolMeta` holding `spec` plus `input_params`, the call schema
derived from this body's signature (filtered to `spec.params`, refined by `spec.param_schema`). Every contract field
— description, capability, tags, requires / provides / invalidates, location freshness — is read back off the spec,
so an implementation has no channel for saying something the vocabulary does not.

A signature that cannot accept a parameter the spec promises raises `ContractViolation` at import time.

Bring-up, calibration and debug views are **not** actions: leave them undecorated and drive them from `scripts/`.

## Tool generation

```python
build_robot_tools(api, *, env=None, allow=None, deny=None) -> list[Any]
list_tool_meta(api, *, env=None) -> list[dict]
```

When an Env is supplied, generated tools are gated by `api.capabilities ∩ env.capabilities`. `allow` and `deny` filter
by tool name.

## Aggregated and code tools

```python
RobotControlTool(
    api,
    *,
    env=None,
    name="robot_control",
    description=None,
    agent_id=None,
)
```

`available_actions` lists dispatchable actions. `invoke({"action": ..., "params": {...}})` returns a `ToolOutput`.
Safety and trace Rails transparently unwrap this aggregate call to the real action.

```python
InProcessCodeTool(globals_provider)
```

`run(code)` executes Python in process and returns a result dictionary. `as_openjiuwen_tool(**kwargs)` creates a
`LocalFunction`. `globals_provider` must return a fresh globals mapping for each execution.
