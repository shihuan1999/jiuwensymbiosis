# JiuwenSymbiosis Feature Matrix

> Category: Reference. This page records features present in the current code, built-in adapter support, and activation conditions; it is not a roadmap.

The matrix follows `KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`, Env capability declarations, the action vocabulary (`api/actions.py`), `RobotAgentConfig`, and `pyproject.toml`. See [Architecture](../explanation/architecture.md) for call relationships and the [Robot Adapter Reference](adapter-reference.md) for exact contracts.

## 1. Status legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Direct implementation exists in this repository and is usable with its configuration |
| ◐ | Conditional support requiring an optional dependency, hardware, calibration, or explicit switch |
| ◇ | Framework vocabulary or extension contract exists, but no built-in adapter implements it |
| — | The object does not declare or provide this capability |

Support means that a code path and interface exist; it does not certify every robot, firmware, or workspace. Accept real hardware according to the [porting guide](../how-to/port-hardware-adapter.md).

## 2. Built-in hardware adapter matrix

| Feature | MockArm | Piper | SO-101 | Cruzr |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Positioning | In-memory 4-DoF simulated arm | AgileX Piper 6-DoF CAN arm | LeRobot SO-101 underactuated 5-DoF arm | Cruzr mobile dual-arm (base + lift + waist) |

| Parallel gripper | ✅ Simulated state | ✅ Two-state operation with configured width/effort | ✅ Two-state percentage control with conservative contact detection | — |
| Paddle grasp | — | — | — | ✅ `grasp.paddle` (two plates clamp a face each; force-confirmed) |
| Suction | — | — | — | — |
| RGB | ✅ Synthetic image | ◐ Wrist RealSense | ◐ Desktop RealSense D405 | ✅ Waist + head, dual cameras |
| Depth | ◐ Test scenes can provide it, but `vision.depth` is not advertised | ◐ With camera enabled | ◐ With camera enabled | ✅ Waist RGBD |
| Open-vocabulary detection | ✅ Test/simulation path | ◐ Camera plus detector service | ◐ Camera plus detector service | ◐ Camera plus detector service |
| Active search | — | — | — | ✅ `vision.search` + `search_target` (head/waist sweep) |
| Camera mounting | Synthetic scene | Eye-in-hand | Eye-to-hand | Eye-to-hand (static waist + moving head) |
| Hand-eye transform | Test geometry | `T_base_flange(live) @ T_flange_cam` | Fixed `T_base_cam` | Fixed `T_base_cam` (waist) |
| Reachability (URDF) | — | — | — | ✅ `planning.reachability` (dual-arm + adaptive-lift judge) |
| Detector sidecar | — | ◐ `detector.spawn=true` | ◐ `detector.spawn=true` | ◐ (`api_servers`) |
| Main optional dependency | `dev` for tests | `piper`; add `full` for vision | Python 3.12 + `so101`; add `full` for vision | `cruzr`; add `full` for vision; source the ROS workspace at runtime |
| Configuration directory | Tests or examples | `configs/piper/` | `configs/so101/` | `configs/cruzr/` |

Visual capability activation differs:

- Piper's class-level capability set includes vision. With no `camera_serial`, no camera is created; a visual task still requires camera hardware, calibration, and a detector.
- SO-101 derives instance capabilities from `camera_serial`. With no configured camera it does not advertise vision, and a connected Driver can narrow capabilities further when it reports no camera. A configured camera that fails to start makes connection fail closed.
- Cruzr declares waist + head cameras and depth. Vision is served via `api_servers`; when the detector is unreachable the shared client returns empty results, converted to `{"ok": false, "reason": "no_detection"}`.

## 3. Framework Capability matrix

Capability axes are **orthogonal and freely combinable**: motion (cartesian/joint/servo/base/base_servo/lift/waist/goal/dual_arm), sensing (camera/depth/detection/search/eye_to_hand), end effector (parallel/suction/paddle), and planning (reachability) each stand alone.

| Capability | Framework interface | Actions (`ActionSpec`) | MockArm | Piper | SO-101 | Cruzr |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `motion.cartesian` | `CartesianDriver` | `goto_xyzr`, `goto_pose`, `move_direction`, `get_pose`, `get_home_pose` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| `motion.joint` | `JointDriver`/`NamedJointDriver` | `move_joint`, `move_named_joint`, `get_joint_positions` | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `motion.servo` | `ServoDriver` + fast-controller hook | — (no standalone public action; reachable via `robot_control`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| `motion.base` | Env verbs `navigate_relative`/`navigate_arc` | `navigate_relative`, `rotate_base`, `drive_arc` | — | — | — | ✅ |
| `motion.base_servo` | Env verbs `start_base_drive` etc. | — (continuous base-drive primitive) | — | — | — | ✅ |
| `motion.lift` | Env verb `set_lifter` | `set_lift_pose`, `lift_to_clearance` | — | — | — | ✅ |
| `motion.waist` | Env verb `turn_waist` | `turn_waist` | — | — | — | ✅ |
| `motion.goal` | `motion/approach` | `approach_for_grasp`, `approach_for_place` | — | — | — | ✅ |
| `motion.dual_arm` | `motion/dual_arm` | `dual_arm_grasp`, `dual_arm_place` | — | — | — | ✅ |
| `grasp.parallel` | `GripperDriver` | `open_gripper`, `close_gripper` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| `grasp.paddle` | Body `dual_arm_grasp` | — (implemented via `dual_arm_grasp`) | — | — | — | ✅ |
| `grasp.suction` | `SuctionDriver` | `activate_suction`, `deactivate_suction` | — | — | — | — |
| `vision.camera` | `grab_rgb`/`grab_calibrated_frame` | `get_image`, `pixel_to_base_xyz` | ✅ | ◐ | ◐ | ✅ |
| `vision.depth` | `grab_calibrated_frame` | — (no standalone action) | — | ◐ | ◐ | ✅ |
| `vision.detection` | `vision.detect_and_centroid` + raw projection seam | `get_grasp_info_simple`, `locate_for_grasp`, `locate_for_place`, `analyze_scene` | ✅ | ◐ | ◐ | ◐ |
| `vision.eye_to_hand` | Camera-mount marker | — (no standalone action) | — | — | ◐ | ✅ |
| `vision.search` | `motion/approach.search_target` | `search_target` | — | — | — | ✅ |
| `planning.reachability` | `Reachability` (derived) | — (planning-time judge) | — | — | — | ✅ |
| `sorting.command` | Vocabulary and adapter extension point | — (no built-in generic tool) | — | — | — | — |
| `speech.tts` | Vocabulary marker; voice front end provides TTS separately | — (no built-in robot action) | — | — | — | — |

The framework fully defines `grasp.suction`, but this repository has no built-in real suction adapter. The Tutorial's SCARA-with-suction implementation is educational and is not hardware-accepted built-in support.

## 4. Execution and tool strategy matrix

| Feature | Status | Default | Activation or constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| fastagent compile-once | ✅ | `exec_mode="fastagent"` | One model plan (tiered skill + action composition) then execute sequentially, no per-step LLM; `--stepagent` forces per-step |
| Runtime re-planning | ✅ | Before each step | Re-plan when the world contradicts the next step's pre-conditions, capped by `max_replans` |
| Individual tool mode | ✅ | Optional | `mode="tool"`; each `@implements` method becomes one tool |
| Code mode | ✅ | Optional | `mode="code"`; provides `InProcessCodeTool` |
| Hybrid mode | ✅ | `mode="hybrid"` | Provides individual and code tools together |
| Skill workflows | ◐ | `enable_skill=False` | Enables `SkillUseRail` and `RobotControlTool`; built-in `visual_pick`/`visual_place`/`transport` |
| Custom tools/Rails | ✅ | None | Inject through `extra_tools` and `extra_rails` |
| Parallel tool calls | ◐ | `parallel_tool_calls=False` | Only for audited non-motion tools; motion/grasp rejects it, and it cannot run with Trace |
| No-hardware/no-model dry run | ✅ | With `--mock` | `MockArmEnv` + `MockModel` (Piper only); no CAN, camera, or model endpoint |

## 5. Rails, Trace, and feedback matrix

| Capability | Status | Default | Automatic condition or dependency |
|---|---|---|---|
| SafetyRail | ✅ | On | Env has any motion capability (cartesian/joint/base/lift/waist); checks derived from declared capability |
| RecoveryRail | ✅ | On | Motion, suction, or gripper; attempts Home and release after failure |
| VisualFeedbackRail | ◐ | On | Also requires `vision.camera`; stages a post-action frame |
| SkillUseRail | ◐ | Off | `enable_skill=True` |
| TraceRail | ◐ | Off | `enable_tracing=True`; records tools, observations, Rail events, logs, and optional frames |
| DiagnosisRail | ◐ | Off | `enable_diagnosis=True` and tracing must also be enabled |
| WARNING+ logs in Trace | ◐ | With Trace | `trace_capture_loggers` defaults to `jiuwensymbiosis` |
| Trace HTML/text replay | ✅ | On demand | `jiuwensymbiosis-replay <trace.json>`; default output is self-contained HTML |
| Offline Trace Feedback | ✅ | On demand | `scripts/analyze_traces.py` clusters failures and produces human-review proposals |
| Central logging | ✅ | INFO + `./logs` | Console plus rotating file; `log_dir=None` is console-only |

## 6. Vision and perception matrix

| Feature | Status | Implementation or condition |
|---|---|---|
| RGB plus aligned depth | ◐ | RealSense/adapter Driver; depth boundary is meters |
| GroundingDINO text detection | ◐ | Install `full` and start or connect the detector service |
| SAM2 masks | ◐ | Detector configuration `use_sam2=true` |
| Detector sidecar lifecycle | ✅ | `make_detector_sidecar()` follows Session lifecycle |
| Mask centroid and median depth | ✅ | `scene3d.locate_for_grasp`/`analyze_scene` |
| Eye-in-hand projection | ✅ | Piper implementation; needs `T_flange_cam` and live flange pose |
| Eye-to-hand projection | ✅ | SO-101 / Cruzr implementation; needs fixed `T_base_cam` |
| Multi-point/translation XY correction | ✅ | `apply_xy_correction()`; multi-point transform takes priority |
| Grasp and place heights | ✅ | `grasp_z_offset_mm` and `place_z_offset_mm` applied uniformly |
| Active search | ✅ | `motion/approach.search_target`: sweep in place, report bearing, converge |
| Reachability prior | ◐ | Derived `planning.reachability` when the body ships a URDF + arm chains; Cruzr provides a dual-arm + lift judge |
| Hand-eye calibration script | ◐ | Install `calib`; see [Calibrate Hand-Eye Geometry](../how-to/calibrate-hand-eye.md) for Piper |
