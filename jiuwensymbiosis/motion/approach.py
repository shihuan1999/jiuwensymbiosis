"""Body-agnostic base approach: coarse search → face the target → converge to a work pose.

Three layers, each reusable by any differential-drive mobile manipulator:

* **pure geometry** — the advance-step policies and the face/edge normal selectors
  (:func:`forward_step`, :func:`near_face_normal`, …). No robot, no state, no I/O.
* **tuning** — :class:`ApproachTuning` gathers the knobs the loops read off a body
  config **by field name**, so a second body only has to name its YAML fields the
  same way; a field it omits falls back to the documented default here.
* **loops** — ``api``-first functions (:func:`face_by_sweep`, :func:`approach_for_grasp`,
  …) driven through a handful of hooks on the api object, so the hardware-specific
  half (which camera, which drive handle) stays with the adapter.

The action-layer entry points live in :mod:`jiuwensymbiosis.api.defaults`, which forwards
straight into this module — the same one hop every other action takes. The loops are handed
the ADAPTER and resolve the hooks they need from it (see the ``_tuning`` / ``_base_driver``
/ … block below), so nothing has to stand between the two.

Two sensors, by role rather than by mounting point. The **precise** sensor is the
short-range metric RGBD that yields base-frame 3-D (Cruzr's waist camera); the
**coarse** sensor is an optional wide-FOV camera that yields a bearing only
(Cruzr's head). A body with no coarse sensor degrades gracefully: the search then
only covers the precise sensor's current view plus the 180° turn.

    """Face ``object_name`` by its PERCEIVED bearing, choosing what to do next by WHAT THE
    CAMERAS COULD ANSWER rather than by which camera was asked.

    Two answers are possible and they lead to different moves:

    * **A metric hit** — some camera's frame carried depth, so the target's position AND face
      normal are known. Square up to it directly (``_align``); no driving needed to learn more.
    * **Only a bearing** — every camera that saw it gave a direction and nothing else. Then the
      only useful move is to CLOSE IN along that direction (:func:`coarse_approach`) until a
      frame with depth acquires the target, and square up then.

    Which is a property of the FRAMES, not of the hardware: a body with one RGBD camera takes
    the first path, cruzr's head (no depth) takes the second and hands over to its waist RGBD,
    and a plain-RGB-only body takes the second until it is close enough for… nothing, and fails
    safe. ``detect_fn`` looks through every camera for a metric answer;
    ``api.sweep_for_bearing`` looks through every camera for a direction, additionally aiming
    any camera the body can aim (cruzr pans its head left + right once each).

    Search shape: try for a metric hit in the current view first (a near/front target aligns
    with no motion); on a miss sweep for a bearing over the CURRENT facing and hand off to the
    close-in. If that finds nothing either, the base rotates 180° ONCE and both passes repeat on
    the half behind us. Fails safe (``not_found_reason``) if neither facing resolves the target —
    the caller must NOT grasp/place blindly. A body that can aim nothing keeps the default hook,
    so its sweep is just "look with what I have", and it still gets the 180° re-scan.

    ``head_name`` is the noun the coarse sensor searches and ``head_on`` (optional) the reference it
    2-D-verifies the hit rests on. For a *grounded* grasp (``locate_for_grasp(target, on=surface)``) the
    coarse sensor searches the REAL target and verifies it on the reference surface
    (``head_name=target, head_on=surface``); for a *grounded* place it searches the reference object
    (which sits ON the surface, so its bearing ≈ the surface's) and verifies it on the surface
    (``head_name=reference, head_on=object_name``). ``head_on=None`` → plain bearing search, which is also
    what every relation other than ``on`` gets: 2-D bbox containment can only decide ``on``.
    The precise ``detect_fn`` still does the final grounding once close.

    ``detect_fn(object_name)`` must return ``center_mm`` (base frame) on ``ok`` and cache its own result for
    downstream consumers (the grasp/place tools).

    (:func:`approach_single_shot`): from ONE detection it drives the whole route to the work pose — a
    RIGHT-ANGLE (L-shaped) route onto the target's face-normal line — then takes ONE final re-detect + a
    single alignment, with NO per-step re-detect polling. When disabled, or when the face normal is
    untrustworthy, it falls back to the discrete polling loop described here.

    An end-effector that closes along the base Y axis IGNORES the target's yaw, so the base must face the
    target's near face perpendicular. On a differential base (no strafe) "square to the face" and "centred
    on the centroid" only coincide when the base sits on the face-normal line; chasing centring (radial)
    *after* squaring rotates the target back off-square. So we SQUARE FIRST: rotate in place (forward=0) to
    face ONE of the target's vertical faces, then advance STRAIGHT in (turn=0), which preserves the square.
    Which face is HYSTERESIS-LOCKED on the first footprint frame and only re-picked near that lock
    afterwards (frame-compensated for each base turn), so a jittery footprint yaw can't 90°-flip the face.
    Only a frame with no footprint (no ``yaw_rad``) falls back to the plain radial centre+advance. Both
    motions are in-place-turn or turn=0 straight-in — no turn+forward lunge — so neither can drive the base
    into the target. The square tolerance is ``grasp_square_tol_rad`` (must exceed the footprint-yaw jitter,
    else a jittery target only ever rotates and never advances). Leaves the converged fresh detection
    cached for the grasp tool (no separate re-detect).

    The route (``plan_grasp_right_angle``) is two perpendicular straight legs joined by in-place turns, so a

    the loop restarts from the original detection. The final cached ``_last_detection`` reflects the ALIGNED
    pose, which the grasp tool consumes directly (it does not re-detect).

    SQUARE FIRST, then advance STRAIGHT in (turn=0) — the SAME structure as :func:`approach_for_grasp`. On a
    differential base (no strafe) "square to the edge" and "facing the centroid" only coincide when the base
    sits on the edge normal; chasing the centroid (radial) *after* squaring rotates the base back
    off-square. So each iteration: rotate in place to the near-edge normal (forward=0), then drive straight
    at it (turn=0), never re-centring by turning. The base is deliberately NOT driven laterally to the edge
    midpoint — that needs a ~90° sideways swing that flings a carried payload; the payload is instead
    centred ON the surface by the place tool. The near-edge normal is preferred from the near-edge line fit,
    else the hysteresis-locked footprint normal; only a frame with no footprint falls back to plain radial
    centre+advance. The straight-in advance uses the reserve strategy (:func:`place_forward_step`): ≤2
