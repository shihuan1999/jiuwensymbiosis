"""Base class for robot control APIs.

A concrete robot API subclasses `BaseRobotApi` and binds each action it offers to
one entry of the shared vocabulary (`jiuwensymbiosis.api.actions`) with
`@implements`. The bindings declare what the API offers; the env declares what
hardware can do; the agent profile intersects the two and only exposes tools both
sides agree on.

Example:

    class RobotApi(BaseRobotApi):
        @implements(GOTO_XYZR)
        def goto_xyzr(self, x, y, z, r=None): ...     # body-specific geometry

        @implements(ACTIVATE_SUCTION)
        def activate_suction(self): return defaults.activate_suction(self)
