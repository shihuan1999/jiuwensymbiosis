"""The shared action vocabulary — what an action *is*, separately from how a body does it.

A planner (or a coding agent authoring a skill) reasons over action **names and
contracts**. If every body were free to invent both, nothing it learned on one
robot would transfer to the next, and a SKILL.md could not be written once and run
anywhere. So the vocabulary is closed and lives here, next to its siblings
``env/base.py:KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`` and ``api/state.py:KNOWN_STATE_TOKENS``:

    one action = one ActionSpec (the contract, body-agnostic) + N body implementations.

Before this module the contract was re-declared on every implementation — a mixin
wrote ``@robot_tool(desc=…, requires=…, provides=…)`` and each adapter that
overrode the method wrote it again. 20 of 39 action names carried 2–4 copies, and
they had already drifted: ``move_joint`` meant "the whole joint vector" on one body
and "one shoulder pitch value" on another. A spec cannot drift because there is
only ever one of it.

**Capability gating reads the spec, not the class.** Which capability an action
belongs to is a property of the action, so it is declared here once. That also
removes a whole failure mode: gating used to be resolved by walking the MRO for
whichever class happened to declare a ``capability`` attribute, which silently
gated every tool an adapter declared alongside its vision tools.

**Params.** A spec lists the parameter *names* a planner may use and which of them
are mandatory; the JSON Schema (types, defaults) is still derived from the
implementation's signature, where the type checker already sees it.
``implements()`` verifies at import time that an implementation accepts every
contract param — a body may add optional params of its own, never drop one.

Adding an action:
  1. Add its ``ActionSpec`` here (name, capability, params, result shape, contract).
  2. Implement it with ``@implements(THE_SPEC)`` on the adapter's Api — forwarding to
     ``api.defaults`` when the body has nothing of its own to say.
  3. Nothing else — tool emission, prompt rendering and sequence validation all
     read the resulting ``ToolMeta`` exactly as before.
