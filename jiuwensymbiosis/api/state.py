"""World-state vocabulary — what actions and skills declare and reason over.

An action's planning contract has three independent parts, because the things a
plan can get wrong are of three kinds.

**1. Robot self-state — a closed token vocabulary.**
Whether the end effector holds something, whether the body is home. These are
properties of the robot, not of the task, so a small closed set covers every
task: pressing a doorbell, opening a door, wiping, pouring, inspecting, or
pick-and-place. A task that does not manipulate simply never mentions them.

**2. Location freshness — scoped to the referent, tracked automatically.**
"Do I have a usable position for the thing this step is about?" is per-object,
and the object identity is *already* in the sequence: the ``bind`` name. So a
step that produces a location marks its bind **fresh**; an action that moves the
base marks every prior location **stale**; a step that consumes a location
requires a fresh one. No vocabulary is invented, and it generalises with no
role bias — one referent (``doorbell``) or two (``box`` and ``table``) work the
same way.

**3. Access — also scoped to the referent, also tracked automatically.**
"Can I reach the thing at all, or is something in the way?" A shut cabinet, a
closed drawer, a lid, a crate stacked on top, a locked door: one situation, many
nouns. It is not robot self-state (it is a fact about one object, not about the
robot) and not location freshness (the position is known perfectly well — the
hand just cannot get there). So it is its own part, and it needs exactly one
declaration: an action says ``opens_access`` / ``closes_access``, meaning it
un-blocks or re-blocks the thing it acts on.

Nothing else is annotated, because the sequence already says which steps reach
through a barrier: the task's own spatial qualifier (``reference`` +
``relation`` over :data:`CONTAINMENT_RELATIONS`) says the target is *inside*
something, and :data:`PAYLOAD_TOKENS` says which steps actually manipulate as
opposed to merely look or drive. Looking at a shut cabinet is how you find it;
reaching into one is the error. See ``agent/fast/sequence.py`` for the two rules
this supports — a plan that contradicts itself, and a plan contradicted by what
the pre-plan look saw.

Deliberately *not* modelled here: task roles such as "target" vs "destination".
Those describe pick-and-place, and would over-fit the framework to that one task
family — a doorbell has no destination, an inspection has no payload.

The contract never encodes an order. It states pre-conditions and effects, so a
planner can **derive** a legal order; any permutation whose pre-conditions hold
is accepted.

Adding a token:
  1. Append it here (and to ``EXCLUDES`` if it rules a sibling out).
  2. Annotate the actions that require/provide/invalidate it.
  3. Teach ``WorldState`` how to observe it.
