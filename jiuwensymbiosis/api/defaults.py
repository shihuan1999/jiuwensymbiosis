"""Reusable action implementations, as plain functions.

Most actions have an implementation that works on any body meeting the Env
contract: ``goto_xyzr`` is ``env.move_to_flange(...)``, ``navigate_relative`` is
``env.navigate_relative(...)``. Those live here so a new adapter does not rewrite
them — but as **functions it calls**, not as a base class it inherits:

    class PiperApi(BaseRobotApi):
        @implements(MOVE_DIRECTION)
        def move_direction(self, direction: str, distance_mm: float) -> dict:
            return defaults.move_direction(self, direction, distance_mm)

Inheritance would bundle: taking ``goto_xyzr`` would mean taking ``get_pose``,
``get_home_pose`` and ``move_direction`` too, and the MRO decided which of two
mixins won when both defined a name. A function has neither problem, and — the
point of the shape — **the adapter file lists every action the body offers**,
instead of that list being spread across a base-class tuple.

Each function takes the api object first (``api``), reads ``api.env`` and nothing
else about the body, and matches its ``ActionSpec`` signature exactly.
