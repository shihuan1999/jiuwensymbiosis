"""``ExecutionMemory`` — what running actions has established, per session.

Two things a planner needs to know at plan time, both produced by *executing*
actions rather than by reading a sensor:

* **where things are** — the most recent sensing per referent, and whether it is
  still valid (moving the body invalidates every reading taken from the old
  standpoint);
* **robot self-state** — believed tokens (``payload.held``, ``body.home``, …),
  advanced by each action's declared effects.

They live in one object because one hook maintains both: every dispatch calls
:meth:`ExecutionMemory.observe` with the action's ``ToolMeta``, params and result.
Belief is corrected by observation wherever the env can actually measure the
thing (see ``WorldState``); it is a starting point, not the last word.

This owns **whether a reading is still valid**, for every body: the bookkeeping is
identical everywhere and only the framework knows the action contracts that drive
it. It does not replace the api's ``last_detection`` / ``last_surface`` cache,
which still holds the sensing *payload* a grasp/place step consumes — that cache
keeps two role-separated slots (object vs support surface) which ``locations``,
keyed by referent, cannot express. The two stay consistent because one hook drives
both: the dispatch layer clears the cache exactly when it invalidates these
locations (``tools/robot_control_tool.py:_stale_sensing_cache`` →
``BaseRobotApi.invalidate_sensing_cache``). Do not add a second invalidation site.

**Only successful actions count.** A detection that ran and returned
``ok=False`` establishes nothing, so a later step that needs a location finds
none and the caller can re-plan — which is exactly how "the target was not in
view, go search for it" recovers without any special-casing.
