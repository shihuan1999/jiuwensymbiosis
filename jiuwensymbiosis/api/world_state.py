"""``WorldState`` — what is true right now, in the planner's own vocabulary.

A planner can only derive an order if it knows where it is starting from. This
assembles that starting point from three sources, in order of authority:

1. **Observation** — what the env can actually measure (``holding_payload``,
   pose, joints). Authoritative: it overrides belief.
2. **Belief** — tokens established by the actions run so far
   (``ExecutionMemory.self_state``). Covers what no sensor reports, such as
   whether a carried payload has been raised to travel height.
3. **Proprioception + scene** — pose / joints / extra from the env observation,
   and sensed locations from ``ExecutionMemory``. Not tokens; context the planner
   reasons over directly.

Everything is best-effort: a body that cannot report something simply omits it,
and an omitted token means *unknown*, never *false*. That distinction matters —
``parse_sequence`` disables self-state checking when the state is unknown rather
than rejecting plans against a guess.
