"""SO-101 adapter config.

SO-101 is a 5-DoF underactuated arm (Feetech STS3215 servos) driven by the
LeRobot 0.6.x ``SOFollower``. This config captures the per-robot knobs the
adapter needs (serial port, explicit safe home joints, soft limits, IK weights,
gripper two-state percentages) and validates them at load time.

See ``.claude/plans/so101-adapter.md`` for the verified baseline.
