        Two things here are paddle facts and nothing else's: the CLAMP targets keep the gap
        the grasp actually achieved (re-deriving it from the box width squeezes or drops the
        box during the long, arms-extended descent), and each paddle is pulled a little PAST
        that held position toward the centre so the arms actively press in — commanding the
        exact held gap leaves near-zero position error, so a stiff controller applies almost
        no inward force and the box slides out.
