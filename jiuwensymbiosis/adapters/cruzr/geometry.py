"""Cruzr body geometry — the physical-machine facts of this robot.

Two irreducibly body-specific pieces (no generic abstraction exists for a sample
of one — see the porting notes): the dual-arm **paddle grasp planner** (paddle TCP
offset + tool axes + side-clamp targeting, per-arm IK) and the 3-joint **lifter**
level-torso manifold reach search. Both call the *generic* solvers in
``jiuwensymbiosis.kinematics`` — only the paddle/lifter geometry lives here.

Merged from the former ``grasp_planner.py`` + ``lifter.py`` so the adapter keeps
only the skeleton files (config/env/session/lowlevel/api/geometry/_calibration).
