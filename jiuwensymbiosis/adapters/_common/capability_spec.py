"""Capability → contract maps shared by the adapter validator and generator.

Single source of truth so ``scripts/validate_adapter.py`` (the checker) and
``scripts/new_adapter/`` (the generator) never drift on *which* actions a
capability gates, *which* low-level driver members it delegates to, or which of
them the framework already implements. Mirrors ``api/defaults.py`` and
``env/protocol.py``; the capability vocabulary itself lives in
``env/base.py:KNOWN_CAPABILITIES``.

Kept import-light (plain dict literals, no heavy deps) so the validator can run
even when a robot's hardware packages are absent.
