"""3-D scene sensing over one calibrated frame — robot-agnostic.

Everything here is a pure function of ``(rgb, depth, intrinsics, base←camera)``
plus a segmentation callable: no robot, no config object, no cached state. That
is what lets a second body reuse the whole grounded-detection pipeline by
supplying a frame and a detector, and it is what makes these functions testable
without hardware.

Two shapes of answer, because callers need different payloads from the same
geometry: an **object** answer (centre / extents / face normal — what a grasp
planner consumes) and a **surface** answer (footprint + near-edge line — what a
place planner consumes).

Both come in a plain and a *grounded* variant. Grounding resolves "the white box
**on** the brown table", "the box **beside** the hat" and their mirrors by sensing
both things from the same frame and keeping only the pair that satisfies the named
relation (:func:`relation_holds`, over the closed set :data:`SPATIAL_RELATIONS`).
One frame, not two: a second grab would be taken from a slightly different instant
and the relation could disagree with itself.
