"""RecoveryRail — payload-aware auto-home/release on tool exceptions.

If a motion tool raises (e.g. driver lost connection, IK failed), leaving
the arm mid-motion at an unknown pose is unsafe for the next call. The
rail attempts a `home()` and `deactivate_suction()` (best-effort, both
optional) to bring the robot to a known state before the LLM retries.

Notes:
- Only triggers for tools whose tags include "motion" or "grasp", to avoid
  reacting to vision/diagnostic exceptions.
- Recovery actions themselves are NOT railed (they wrap the env directly,
  not the api), so a recovery failure is logged but does not crash the
  rail.
- Adapter-specific exceptions may set ``skip_recovery = True`` when the command
  was rejected before leaving the arm in an unsafe state; those are surfaced to
  the caller without an automatic home move.
- A motion failure while the adapter reports ``holding_payload=True`` keeps the
  end effector closed and attempts a payload-aware recovery home. It never
  drops the payload merely because endpoint settle was outside tolerance.
- If ``home`` itself fails, recovery does not retry the same failed home motion.

Two optional api hooks let a body join this without a bespoke rail, both looked
up by name so no adapter import is needed:

- ``release_effector()`` — release for bodies whose end effector is neither a
  suction cup nor a parallel gripper (dual-arm paddles, magnets, …). Tried after
  ``deactivate_suction`` / ``open_gripper``, before the env-level fallback.
- ``recovery_home()`` — the payload-aware retreat, preferred over ``home()``.
  A body whose plain ``home()`` would drop a held payload implements it.
