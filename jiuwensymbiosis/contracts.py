"""Action result types — the data contract between ActionSpec and implementations.

This module is the **single source of truth** for what shape each action returns.

It sits at the package root, belonging to NEITHER side, because both sides read it:
``api/actions.py`` promises these shapes, and ``perception/`` / ``motion/`` build
them. Putting it under ``api/`` would only reverse the old problem — the algorithm
libraries would then import the api package (which imports them back through
``api/components.py``). Owned by no layer, it imports nothing from the package, so
neither direction exists and there is no cycle to reason about. That is the module's
one invariant: **keep this file dependency-free.**

**What goes here:**
  - Result ``TypedDict`` types returned by actions (success + failure shapes)
  - Spatial relation constants read by multiple layers
  - Minimal geometry types that cross module boundaries (``BasePoint``)

**What does NOT go here:**
  - Algorithm implementations (those stay in ``motion/``, ``perception/``)
  - Internal data structures used only within one implementation module
  - Configuration classes (those stay in ``adapters/*/config.py``)

The types here are pure data contracts — no methods, no behavior, no dependencies
on hardware or drivers. A ``TypedDict`` is preferred over a class because it is
already the JSON-like dict the LLM and the validator read; a dataclass would only
add a construction step with no runtime benefit.
