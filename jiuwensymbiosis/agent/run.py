"""Unified task entry — the speed switch between the two execution mechanisms.

``run_robot_task(session, query, config)`` dispatches on ``config.exec_mode``:

* ``"stepagent"``: build the ``DeepAgent`` and ``invoke`` it — per-step LLM
  orchestration, many round-trips. Identical to calling ``build_robot_agent`` +
  ``agent.invoke`` directly. For single-step debugging / verification.

* ``"fastagent"`` (the task-running default): the C1 single-source path (see
  ``fast_path_single_source_design.md``).
    1. **Compile once** — a single LLM inference reads the candidate skills'
       SKILL.md (the same files the agent reads) and emits, in that one call, the
       flat **action sequence** for the task (skill selection + workflow
       transcription together — no separate compile round-trip).
    2. **Run** — the generic ``run_sequence`` executes that sequence in order with
       NO per-step LLM, passing detection results between steps and real-time-
       tracking targets at ``track_detect`` steps.

Single source of truth is each skill's SKILL.md; there is no per-skill Python
executor, so fast and agent can never drift, and a new skill is just a new
SKILL.md.

        The interruption reason goes into the task text so the planner works around
        what went wrong instead of re-deriving the sequence that just stopped fitting.

        The SCENE is re-perceived here, not reused. ``check_reachable`` answers "from where
        the body is standing NOW", and the commonest trigger for a re-plan is that the body
        moved — so reusing the pre-run annotations would hand the planner reachability
        computed at a base pose that no longer exists, exactly when it has changed. The same
        goes for ``blocked_access``: whether something is still in the way is a fact about
        the present. One extra detection pass is the price; a plan built on a stale scene is
        the alternative.
