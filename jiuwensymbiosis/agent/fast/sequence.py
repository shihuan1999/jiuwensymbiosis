"""Action-sequence schema + safe expression evaluator for the C1 fast path.

The fast path (design: ``fast_path_single_source_design.md``) has the skill-
selection LLM emit, in the *same* call, an ordered **action sequence** — the
deterministic transcription of the selected skills' SKILL.md workflows. A
generic runner then executes that sequence with NO per-step LLM, passing
detection results between steps internally.

This module is the contract between the LLM (producer) and the runner
(consumer). It defines:

  * ``ActionStep`` — one step: an ``op`` (an ``@implements`` action name, or the
    compound real-time op ``track_detect``) + ``params`` (literals or symbolic
    expressions) + optional ``bind`` for detection steps.
  * ``parse_sequence`` — validate a raw ``list[dict]`` (the LLM output) into
    ``list[ActionStep]``, rejecting unknown ops / malformed detection steps.
  * ``evaluate_expr`` / ``resolve_params`` — a **whitelisted-AST** evaluator so a
    param like ``"obj.z"`` or ``"obj.z + 30"`` resolves against the
    runtime variable environment (the detection bindings). It never executes
    arbitrary Python: only numbers, ``+ - * /``, unary ``-``, name lookup,
    ``var.field``, and ``var.field[idx]`` are allowed.
  * ``normalize_detection`` — the **task-agnostic** shape a detection binds: the
    raw perception fields passed through, plus geometric conveniences
    ``x/y/z = position[0]/[1]/[2]``. It bakes in NO task semantics (no
    pick/place); which field an expression reads (``grasp_z``, ``place_z``,
    ``position[0]``, …) is decided by the skill's SKILL.md, so the same
    machinery serves pick-place, carry, push, wipe, … equally.

Why string-or-number params: numeric targets (``goto_xyzr`` x/y/z) are
expressions; string args (``object_name``) are literals. ``resolve_params``
distinguishes them by trying to evaluate; a value that does not parse as a
numeric expression (e.g. ``"红杯子"``) is left as the literal string.

    """Validate a raw action sequence (the LLM output) into ``list[ActionStep]``.

    Five independent checks, each rejecting only what it can prove wrong so a plan
    the planner derived on its own is not second-guessed. **None of them imposes an
    order** — they reject unmet pre-conditions, so any permutation that satisfies
    them is accepted.

    1. *Vocabulary* — the op exists and, for a compound op, is authorized.
    2. *Bindings* — ``<bind>.field`` reads a name an earlier step bound, and (when
       the producing action publishes a ``returns`` schema) a field it really emits.
    3. *Location freshness* — a bind read for coordinates is still valid: an action
       that moved the body since it was sensed makes it stale.
    4. *Robot self-state* — each action's ``requires`` holds, given ``initial_state``
       advanced by every preceding action's effects.
    5. *Access* — nothing is in the way of what a step reaches for: no reaching into a
       container this plan only opens later, and none into one perception found shut.

    Args:
        raw: the LLM-produced sequence — must be a ``list`` of ``dict`` steps.
        allowed_ops: the action names the runner can execute. Pass the action
            **index** (``{name: bound_method}``) to enable checks 2–4; a bare set of
            names still works but carries no contract, so those checks no-op. A name
            in ``KNOWN_SPECIAL_OPS`` is **never** authorized via ``allowed_ops`` — it
            must be explicitly listed in ``special_ops``.
        special_ops: runner-owned compound operations authorized for this
            session. Defaults to empty — so callers that use no special ops
            stay compatible (``parse_sequence(raw, allowed_ops=...)`` still
            works), and ``track_detect`` / ``track_grasp`` are never implicitly
            authorized: an empty set rejects any special op with a
            ``SequenceError`` rather than silently letting it through.
        initial_state: robot self-state tokens true before the first step (from
            ``WorldState``). ``None`` means "unknown", which **disables** check 4 —
            asserting pre-conditions against a guessed state would reject valid plans.
        grounding: ``{object: {reference, relation}}`` — the spatial qualifiers the task
            itself stated. A step that could carry one and drops it is rejected: with two
            same-label objects in view, the bare call silently grasps the wrong one.
        blocked_access: ``{thing: what is in its way}`` as the pre-plan look found it —
            a shut container, a crate stacked on top. ``None``/empty leaves check 5 with
            only the plan's own testimony to go on, which is the safe default: a barrier
            nobody observed must not be invented.

    Returns:
        Validated steps, in order.

    Raises:
        SequenceError: on a non-list payload, a malformed step, an unknown op, a
            special op missing ``object_name`` / ``bind``, a param expression that
            reads an unbound / stale / non-existent field, or an unmet requirement.

    The binding is the raw perception dict passed through (so any field the

    addressable), plus purely geometric conveniences ``x/y/z`` taken from
    ``position[0]/[1]/[2]``. NO task semantics are baked in: a pick skill's
    expression reads ``obj.grasp_z``, a place skill reads ``obj.place_z``, a
    carry/push skill reads ``obj.x`` / ``obj.position[0]`` — the choice lives in
    the skill's SKILL.md, not here.

    Args:
        gi: a detection dict with at least ``position`` (``[x, y, z]`` mm). Other
            fields are copied through verbatim.
