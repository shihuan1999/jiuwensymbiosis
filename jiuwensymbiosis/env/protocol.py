"""Driver Protocols — the contract a new vendor implements, split by capability.

These are the surfaces a per-vendor ``XxxLowLevel`` exposes so the cross-vendor
scaffolding (Env wrappers, ``perception.vision``) can bind onto it. There is one
protocol per capability rather than one god-protocol: a mobile dual-arm body has
no flange pose, and a bench arm has no wheels, so a single contract would force
one of them into ``NotImplementedError`` stubs. ``RobotDriver`` therefore holds
only what every driver has — ``close()`` — and each capability adds its own
sibling protocol, mirroring ``CAPABILITY_DRIVER_MEMBERS`` in
``adapters/_common/capability_spec.py`` row for row.

Structural typing (``typing.Protocol``, not a base class) is intentional:

* Adapters compose differently — some hold a single bespoke driver, others
  wire together independent submodules — so an abstract base class would
  force inheritance and lose composability.
* Pose / joint dataclasses are vendor-specific (4-DoF vs 6-DoF).
  A Protocol expresses "has these methods" without enforcing identical
  dataclass shapes.
* Capabilities are *optional*. ``Env.capabilities`` advertises what's
  available and the consumer checks before calling.

Implementer contract:

  1. Construct: open SDK sockets, enable robot, snapshot init pose, load
     calibration, optionally start a camera.
  2. ``get_pose`` and ``home_pose`` return your own vendor Pose dataclass
     — e.g. ``4-DoF (x, y, z, r)`` or ``6-DoF (x, y, z, rx, ry, rz)``.
     The ``XxxEnv.get_observation()`` is what flattens to ``RobotObservation.pose``.
  3. ``move_to_pose_blocking`` speaks FLANGE frame. The api layer's
     ``goto_xyzr`` is responsible for tip↔flange conversion (so the shared
     motion tools work for any tool-offset).
  4. ``close()`` must be idempotent — it's called from ``Env.disconnect``
     which itself may be invoked twice on error paths.

Mobile-body protocols name the verb the way ``BaseRobotEnv`` does, because an
Env without its own implementation forwards to the driver under the same name.
