"""Hardware-protocol abstraction (Layer 2).

`BaseRobotEnv` is the minimal contract every robot body must satisfy.
The framework relies on:
- ``capabilities``: a closed-vocabulary set advertising what the env supports;
  the rails and tool builder gate themselves by these strings.
- ``connect``/``disconnect``: lifecycle. Idempotent.
- ``get_observation``: returns a ``RobotObservation`` with whatever fields
  the env can populate; downstream code checks for ``None`` rather than
  asking ``hasattr``.

Hardware emergency stop must remain a hardware-layer concern; the rails
in this framework do *not* take over physical safety.

        The Env counterpart of the indexed ``move_joint`` above, for bodies whose driver
        speaks ``NamedJointDriver``. It exists so a named-joint body reaches its hardware
        through the SAME Env seam as everyone else: without it an Api had to call
        ``env.low_level`` directly, and everything the framework hangs on this layer —
        logging, rate limiting, recording, any future interception — could not see that
        motion on that body. SafetyRail is unaffected either way (it sits at the tool
        layer, above the Api), so this is a consistency and observability seam, not a
        safety one.

        Vendor tuning (cruzr's ``ramp_duration_s``) rides in ``kwargs``, the same way
        ``CartesianDriver.move_to_pose_blocking`` already carries per-vendor extras — so
        every call site can use this seam without a body-specific concept appearing in the
        base signature.
