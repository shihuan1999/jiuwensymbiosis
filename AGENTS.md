## Project Overview

JiuwenSymbiosis is an embodied agent framework built on `openjiuwen` for robotics. It provides hardware-agnostic tools, safety policies, and multi-agent collaboration. The core design principle is **a shared action vocabulary (ActionSpec) + capability gating**: a single codebase adapts to different robot form factors (6-DoF arm, mobile dual-arm, suction cup, gripper) through one contract per action and per-body `@implements` bindings — new hardware only needs a YAML config + 6 adapter files.

## Critical: Proxy Hygiene

`clear_proxy_env()` (defined in `jiuwensymbiosis/utils/proxy.py`, exported from `jiuwensymbiosis.utils` and `jiuwensymbiosis`) **must** be called before `import openjiuwen`. HTTP proxy env vars cause `httpx` to require `socksio` and route localhost through proxy, breaking local vLLM/detection calls. The root `conftest.py` does this automatically for tests.

## Centralised Logging

`jiuwensymbiosis.utils.logging` provides one choke point for all logging:

- `configure_logging(level="INFO", *, log_dir=None)` — idempotent root-logger setup: one `StreamHandler` with a uniform format (`%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s: %(message)s`) plus an optional `RotatingFileHandler` (`<log_dir>/jiuwensymbiosis.log`, 5 MB / 3 backups). `build_robot_agent` calls it with `RobotAgentConfig.log_level` / `log_dir`.
- `get_logger(name=None)` — thin alias over `logging.getLogger`; new code should use it. Legacy `logging.getLogger(__name__)` calls remain valid.
- The Piper driver's per-run `commands.log` (`_attach_cmd_log_handler`) now routes through `configure_logging` + a tagged `FileHandler` with the same format. Disable with `JIUWEN_PIPER_CMD_LOG=0`; override dir with `JIUWEN_PIPER_CMD_LOG_DIR`.
- `TraceLogHandler` — a `logging.Handler` that forwards `WARNING`+ records from `RobotAgentConfig.trace_capture_loggers` (default `["jiuwensymbiosis"]`) into the active execution trace, so rail warnings / detector failures land in the trace with no business-code changes.

## Architecture: Layered Capability-Gated Design

The framework has 7 layers, with data flowing top-down for commands and bottom-up for observations:

```
Agent Layer       RobotSession + build_robot_agent() + RobotAgentConfig
Safety Rails      SafetyRail / RecoveryRail / VisualFeedbackRail / SkillUseRail (before_tool_call hooks); TraceRail (parallel, optional)
Tool Layer        build_robot_tools(api) | RobotControlTool(api) | InProcessCodeTool
Skill Layer       SKILL.md docs (visual_pick, visual_place, transport) — SkillUseRail (tool path) / plan_task (fast path)
API Layer         ActionSpec vocabulary (api/actions.py) + mixins implementing it (@implements)
Env Layer         BaseRobotEnv — the SINGLE hardware contract (connect/disconnect/observe)
Hardware Layer    XxxDriver — adapter author's main work (serial/CAN/socket)
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Shared Action Vocabulary**: an action's contract — name, capability gate, params, result shape, pre-conditions and effects — is declared **once** in `api/actions.py` as an `ActionSpec`; a body supplies only an *implementation* via `@implements(SPEC)`. So the same action name means the same thing on every robot, and a plan or SKILL.md written for one body is meaningful on the next. There is no second way in: bring-up, calibration and debug views are not actions — they are plain methods driven from `scripts/`. `jiuwensymbiosis-actions --vocabulary` prints the whole vocabulary; `--config <yaml>` prints the subset one body's capabilities admit.

**Capability Gating**: Tools are emitted only for `api.capabilities ∩ env.capabilities`. Env declares what hardware can do (manual `frozenset`); Api derives capabilities from the actions it implements, plus any `capability` class attr for a marker capability no action advertises (automatic). `build_robot_tools(api, env=env)` enforces the intersection — an action whose capability isn't in env simply doesn't become an LLM tool. The capability comes from the action's own `ActionSpec`, never from whichever class declares the method.

**Defaults & Components** (the mixin layer is gone): an action whose implementation is one line of delegation to an Env verb is a plain function in `api/defaults.py` that the adapter calls explicitly — `@implements(GOTO_XYZR)` then `return defaults.goto_xyzr(self, ...)` — so no base class is involved and the MRO stays flat. There is **no `api/components.py` and no held-component class** any more: the shared 3-D sensing and the base-approach loops are `api`-first functions in `perception/scene3d.py` (`locate_for_grasp` / `locate_for_place` / `analyze_scene`) and `motion/approach.py` (`search_target` / `approach_for_grasp` / `approach_for_place`), each resolving its own body hooks off the api it is handed (`detector_seg_fn`, `base_driver`, `grab_calibrated_frame`, …). The sensing *state* those loops read and write (`last_detection` / `last_surface`) lives on `BaseRobotApi` behind properties, and `api/memory.py`'s `ExecutionMemory` owns freshness across actions (an action that stales locations clears the cache through `invalidate_sensing_cache`). `Reachability` (`api/reachability.py`) is not an action provider at all — it is a planning-time judge the planner reads directly (`check_reachable` / `describe_reach`), gated by the *derived* capability `planning.reachability` (body holds a judge AND env ships the URDF). The vendor-specific vision work has no default and is implemented per adapter on top of `perception/vision.py` (`detect_and_centroid`, `apply_xy_correction`, `build_grasp_result`).

**One contract, one carrier, one decorator**: `ActionSpec` (declared in `api/decorators.py`, next to the carrier) is what an action IS; `ToolMeta` is what `@implements(SPEC)` pins to a method — that spec plus `input_params`, the call schema derived from *this body's* signature. `ToolMeta` **holds** its spec instead of copying it, so the contract fields exist in one place and a planner cannot read a different answer from the vocabulary. `build_robot_tools` walks the MRO, finds the decorated methods, binds them, and wraps them as openjiuwen `LocalFunction` tools.

There is no second decorator for "a tool only this body has". Both agent paths build their tool list with `planner_only=True`, so such a tool was never reachable by anything but a hand-written script — which is what bring-up, calibration and debug views should be (a plain method plus something under `scripts/`). If a body genuinely needs one, decide first **how it becomes reachable**.

**Planning Contract** (what makes a body plannable, not just callable): beyond the call schema, every action carries `returns` (result-field JSON Schema, auto-derived from a `TypedDict` return annotation), `requires` / `provides` / `invalidates` (robot self-state, over the closed vocabulary in `api/state.py:KNOWN_STATE_TOKENS`), and `produces_location` / `consumes_location` / `invalidates_locations` (per-referent location freshness — an action that moves the base stales every prior sensed position). `SkillSpec` + SKILL.md frontmatter carry the same fields, because **a skill is a compound action** and both planning tiers share one reasoning machine. The contract never encodes an order; it states pre-conditions and effects so a planner can *derive* one, and `parse_sequence` accepts any permutation whose pre-conditions hold. `WorldState.snapshot(session)` reports the same vocabulary at runtime (observation overrides belief; an absent token means *unknown*, never *false*). Full manual: the architecture guide's two-tier planning section (`docs/zh/explanation/architecture.md`).

**Two Tool Strategies** (can coexist):
- `build_robot_tools(api)` — each `@implements` method becomes a separate LLM tool (good for few tools)
- `RobotControlTool(api)` — single `robot_control` entry point with `action`/`params` dispatch (good for SKILL.md workflows); appended by `build_robot_agent` only when `RobotAgentConfig.enable_skill=True`
- `InProcessCodeTool` — in-process Python execution (available in "code" and "hybrid" modes)

**Safety rails unwrap robot_control**: When RobotControlTool is used, rails transparently unpack `action`/`params` to apply safety checks on the actual motion command.

**RobotSession Lifecycle**: `RobotSession` is a context manager — `__enter__` calls `connect()` (env + sidecars), `__exit__` calls `disconnect()`. Both are idempotent. Sidecars (e.g., detection subprocess) are started/stopped automatically.

**Known Capabilities** (defined in `env/base.py:KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`):
- arm — `motion.cartesian`, `motion.joint`, `motion.servo`
- mobile manipulator — `motion.base`, `motion.base_servo`, `motion.lift`, `motion.waist`, `motion.goal`
- end effector — `grasp.suction`, `grasp.parallel`, `grasp.dual_arm`
- sensing / planning — `vision.camera`, `vision.depth`, `vision.detection`, `vision.eye_to_hand`, `planning.reachability`
- misc — `sorting.command`, `speech.tts`

### Safety & Auxiliary Rails

1. **SafetyRail** — Pre-motion boundary check, with the watch set **derived from declared capabilities** rather than hard-coded: `motion.cartesian` → Z floor (`z_min_safe`) + XY workspace bounds on `goto_xyzr`/`goto_pose`; `motion.joint` → joint soft limits on `move_joint(q)` (`joint_limits`, unit = env's `move_joint` convention); `motion.base` → per-command translation/turn caps (`base_step_limits`) on `navigate_relative`/`rotate_base`/`drive_arc`; `motion.lift` → `lift_limits` on `set_lift_pose`; `motion.waist` → `waist_step_limit_rad` on `turn_waist`. Every envelope property defaults to `None` = **no range check** (type/finite checks still run), so declaring a capability never invents a limit the hardware never stated. Rejects with `ValueError` (per-failure message: missing q / wrong type / length mismatch / non-finite / out of range) so LLM can self-correct.
2. **RecoveryRail** — On motion/grasp failure, auto-homes + releases end-effector to return to safe state. The release step goes through a generic `release_effector()` hook, and homing consults `env.holding_payload` first — a body still carrying a payload must not be homed blindly (that would drop it).
3. **VisualFeedbackRail** — Captures camera frame after every motion/grasp, injects into agent context for VLM result verification.
4. **DiagnosisRail** — Online failure-feedback (Trace Feedback Loop P1): after a failed step, stages a compact diagnosis (current params + relevant recent history + system state) and flushes it into the next LLM turn via `before_model_call`; gated by `enable_diagnosis` (requires `enable_tracing`). Lives in `jiuwensymbiosis/rails/diagnosis.py`.
5. **SkillUseRail** — Loads built-in `SKILL.md` docs and appends `RobotControlTool`; attached only when `RobotAgentConfig.enable_skill=True`. (`rails/__init__.py` re-exports SafetyRail / RecoveryRail / VisualFeedbackRail / DiagnosisRail; `SkillUseRail` lives in `agent/builder.py`.)

Note: `TraceRail` (see "Execution Trace & Replay" below) is another parallel rail that lives in `jiuwensymbiosis/agent/trace.py` — **not** under `rails/` — and is gated by `enable_tracing` rather than a safety flag.

Rails are enabled/disabled via `RobotAgentConfig` flags and gated by session capabilities (e.g., VisualFeedbackRail requires `vision.camera`; SafetyRail attaches when **any** of `motion.cartesian` / `motion.joint` / `motion.base` / `motion.lift` / `motion.waist` is present, so joint-only arms and gripperless mobile bodies both get a pre-check).

### Two-Tier Autonomous Planning (`exec_mode: fastagent`)

`agent/fast/planner.py:plan_task` turns a task into one flat action sequence, then `run_sequence` executes it with **no per-step LLM call**:

- **Tier 1 — skill composition** (`compile_sequence`): given the world state and the capability-filtered skill library, pick the skills *and* expand their workflows into a flat sequence in **one** inference. The happy path therefore costs exactly one LLM round trip.
- **Tier 2 — action composition** (`compose_actions`): no SKILL.md at all — derive a sequence from the action contracts (`requires`/`provides`/location freshness) alone. It takes over on exactly three **decidable** conditions, never on the model's say-so: (1) no skill survives the capability gate, (2) Tier 1 returns an explicit empty array (it is instructed to when nothing fits), (3) Tier 1 exhausts its correction retries — which subsumes "the chosen skills' pre-conditions cannot hold from the current state", since `parse_sequence` rejects that expansion and feeds the reason back.
- **`parse_sequence`** (`agent/fast/sequence.py`) is the safety net between them: it simulates the state forward, checks `requires ⊆ state`, validates every `<bind>.field` against the producing op's `returns`, and names *which action would produce* a missing pre-condition so the compiler's retry loop can self-correct. It rejects unmet pre-conditions, **not** orderings — any permutation that type-checks is accepted.
- **Runtime re-planning** (`runner.py`): before each step the runner re-measures `WorldState` and re-plans (capped by `max_replans`) when the world *contradicts* the next step's pre-conditions. Contradiction, not absence — a body that cannot report a token is ignorant, not falsified, and treating ignorance as falsehood would re-plan forever.

Distilling a successful Tier 2 sequence back into a SKILL.md is **not implemented**; today a new skill is authored by hand (see the architecture guide's two-tier planning section).

### Execution Trace & Replay

`TraceRail` (`jiuwensymbiosis/agent/trace.py`) is an optional parallel rail (enabled via `RobotAgentConfig.enable_tracing`, default **off** for zero overhead) that records each `agent.invoke()` as a structured `ExecutionTrace`:

- Per tool-call step: `tool_name`, `input_params`, `output_summary`, `success`/`error`, `duration_s`, an `observation` snapshot (pose/joints/extra, no raw arrays), and an optional saved `frame_path`.
- Rail events pushed via the `TraceEventSink` interface: SafetyRail rejections, RecoveryRail recovery (with real `home_ok`/`released_ok`), VisualFeedbackRail frame injections.
- `WARNING`+ log lines from `trace_capture_loggers` (default `["jiuwensymbiosis"]`) captured via `TraceLogHandler` — no business-code changes.

The trace JSON is persisted to `<workspace>/traces/{conversation_id}_{timestamp}_{pid}.json` on invoke completion (one write per run); JPEG frames go to `<workspace>/traces/frames/{run_token}/` (one subdir per invoke, so `step_NNN.jpg` never collides across runs) when `trace_save_frames=True`. Override the output dir with `trace_dir` (default `<workspace>/traces`). Cap with `trace_max_entries` / `trace_max_frames`. Full config: `enable_tracing` / `trace_max_entries` / `trace_max_frames` / `trace_save_frames` / `trace_console` / `trace_dir` / `trace_capture_loggers`.

`jiuwensymbiosis-replay <trace.json>` prints a text timeline of steps, rail events, log events, and frame paths. Set `trace_console=True` for a live one-line-per-step dashboard during the run.

### Hardware Adapter Pattern (6 files)

New robot types follow this pattern under `jiuwensymbiosis/adapters/<name>/`:
1. `config.py` — `@dataclass` with `from_yaml()`/`from_dict()`
2. `lowlevel.py` — Driver implementing the **capability-sliced** Protocols in `env/protocol.py`: `RobotDriver` is only `close()`, and a body implements the slices matching what it declares — `CartesianDriver` / `JointDriver` / `ServoDriver` / `BaseDriver` / `ContinuousBaseDriver` / `LifterDriver` / `WaistDriver` / `DualArmDriver` / `CameraDriver` / `SuctionDriver` / `GripperDriver` / `VisionDriver`. A mobile dual-arm body owes nothing to the single-arm Cartesian contract.
3. `env.py` — `BaseRobotEnv` subclass: `capabilities` frozenset, `connect`/`disconnect`/`get_observation`, expose `home_pose`/`tool_offset_mm` plus whichever SafetyRail envelopes the hardware can actually state (`z_min_safe`/`workspace_bounds`/`joint_limits`/`base_step_limits`/`lift_limits`/`waist_step_limit_rad`; each defaults to `None` = unchecked), and `holding_payload` if the body can carry something
4. `api.py` — Multi-inherits Mixins + `BaseRobotApi`; overrides geometry-specific methods, implements vision methods
5. `session.py` — `make_builder(cfg_cls, env_cls, api_cls, ...)` one-liner; `api_kwargs_from_cfg` accepts a declarative list (`["cfg_attr"` or `"cfg_attr:api_kwarg"`, dotted paths OK) so same/near-named cfg→Api field mapping needs no hand-written extractor, and `make_detector_sidecar()` provides the standard detection-server sidecar
6. `config_template.yaml` — YAML template with Chinese annotations

Template at `templates/xxx_adapter/`. Validate statically with `scripts/validate_adapter.py`; smoke-test runtime behavior (every action callable + JSON-serializable, driven by a stub driver) with
`scripts/smoke_test_adapter.py --module <adapter>`.

### Hand Guiding (release torque so a human can pose the arm)

`HandGuidingDriver` (`env/protocol.py`) is an **optional** driver protocol, sibling to
`SuctionDriver` / `GripperDriver`: `hand_guiding(*, include_end_effector=False)` returns a
context manager that drops torque on entry and restores it on exit. Restoring must
resynchronise the motion targets with where the human actually left the robot **before**
re-energising, or the servos snap back to the pre-release goal; failing that raises
`HandGuidingRecoveryError` (the one failure the operator has to react to physically).

`include_end_effector=False` releases the arm only — calibration teaching relies on it to keep
the board clamped in the gripper. `True` releases everything, so whatever it holds will drop.

Consumers probe support with `isinstance(env.low_level, HandGuidingDriver)`, never by body
name. `So101Env.hand_guiding()` is a convenience passthrough. Calibration's own
`ManualGuidance` / `GuidanceHold` ports (`calibration/domain/ports.py`) stay
calibration-owned and delegate down to this driver protocol — the Env deliberately does **not**
satisfy them (`tests/unit_tests/calibration/test_adapter_conformance.py`).

### Hand-Eye Calibration Subsystem

`jiuwensymbiosis/calibration/` is a layered, body-agnostic subsystem consumed by both the
CLI (`scripts/calibrate/`) and the GUI wizard. Dependency direction is one-way: calibration
may import core, core must not import calibration (enforced by
`tests/unit_tests/calibration/test_dependency_direction.py`; `gui/` is an exempt *consumer*
that must still keep its imports lazy).

```
domain/       models · ports (hardware Protocols) · solver · quality · trajectory
workflows/    collect → execute → publication / replay / preflight / profile
artifacts/    self-describing waypoint + station archives; artifact publication
adapters/     per-body wrappers exposing CALIBRATION_ADAPTER_SPEC
integration/  adapter discovery (by naming convention) + reload-smoke validator
```

Three entry points, all headless (they log; they never print or prompt except through an
injectable `prompt_fn`): `collect_waypoints` / `execute_calibration` / `replay_calibration`.

**Publication is fail-closed**: only ACCEPT *plus* a reload smoke test through the adapter's
own runtime loader publishes a formal schema-2 artifact. Anything else lands in a
`.candidate.json` REVIEW report that the runtime loader will not load. Never hand-promote a
candidate — that bypasses both the quality gates and the loader round-trip.

Adding a body to calibration = one wrapper module under `calibration/adapters/` exposing
`CALIBRATION_ADAPTER_SPEC`, plus (for the GUI wizard) one entry in
`gui/data/calibration_profiles.yaml` declaring its trajectory space and calibration-time
limit relaxations.

### Visual Perception Pipeline

Detection runs as a subprocess (GroundingDINO + SAM2) via `perception/detector_sidecar.py`. `RobotSession` manages lifecycle. The body-agnostic `perception/` package provides the shared pipeline: `detector_client.init_detector()`, `vision.detect_and_centroid()`, `vision.apply_xy_correction()`, `object_geometry` (mask → 3D extent), and `scene3d` (the detect → centroid → project → correct → geometry chain behind `Scene3DMixin`).

### Workspace Resolution

Priority: explicit `workspace` arg > `$JIUWENSYMBIOSIS_WORKSPACE` env var > `~/.jiuwensymbiosis/settings.json` > `~/.jiuwensymbiosis/{session.name}_workspace/`

## Instruction Priority

- Follow system, tool, and user instructions first, then this file, then
  module-local docs.
- Before changing behavior, inspect the touched module, its exported
  surface in `__init__.py`, and nearby tests/examples.
- Prefer small, targeted diffs. Do not refactor unrelated areas
  opportunistically.

## More Detail

Topic-scoped rules (short, hard, path-gated) live in `.claude/rules/`;
deep reference manuals (longer, on-demand) live in `.claude/skills/`.
Both are listed in `CLAUDE.md` under "Rules & Skills Index".
